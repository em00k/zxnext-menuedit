In NextZXOS v2.7 + you can edit the default
menu items that appear on start up. This is 
done my configuring a configuration file in 
"c:\nextzxos\enMenus.cfg"

Normally you would have to edit with a text
editor such as qe - but that can be a little
tricky for new-comers so this tool attempts
to bridge that gap.

How to run
Launch the menuedit.bas from the Browser

When MenuEdit starts you will see a familiar 
NextZXOS menu list, cursor up and down will
change the selected menu option and left and 
right will move through other menus available
in the OS. 

You can press M to bring up the LOAD/SAVE/EXIT
menu

Select a menu option and press return to EDIT 
the menu name and command. 

When creating a command it is worth read the 
NextZXOS Guide as this will explain some of the 
internal functions. 

if you use a $ for the command an Action menu
will pop up, things should me self explanotory.

When you have finished editing you menus, PRESS M 
and Save Menu Cfg. You can then QUIT the program
and test your new menu.

If it all goes wonky you can PRESS M and choose 
Default Menu options and save. 

IF YOU SCREW UP YOUR MENUS!!
Dont despair, from basic type : 

erase "c:\nextzxos\enmenu.cfg"

Relaunch the tool, press m and choose Default menu
and then Save Menu CFG 


Enjoi!
